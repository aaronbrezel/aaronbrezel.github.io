title: Hello!

I'm Aaron Brezel, a Brooklyn-based software engineer and computational journalist. 

For three an a half years I worked as founding member of the Reporting Tools team at The Washington Post. There I built data pipelines, command line utilities, semantic vector databases, an LLM-powered video forensics toolâ€”whatever would help the newsroom tell its most ambitious data-driven stories.  

As of Dec. 2024, I work as the lead software engineer for the Local News Lab, an R/D outfit out of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation. There, I build metrics, statistical models and user interfaces that translate web analytics into editorial strategy for small to mid-sized newsrooms.

I use this site to catalog my work. If you're interested in a particular pieces, check out my portfolio. For the full journey, check out my resume. My GitHub and LinkedIn are in the footer.     

Or, if you just want to chat, shoot me an [email](mailto:brezelaaron@gmail.com?subject=Hello from the website!). I love to gab.
